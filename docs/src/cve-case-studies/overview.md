# CVE Case Studies

This section demonstrates how compatmalloc's hardening features detect and prevent exploitation techniques used in real-world CVEs affecting glibc's heap allocator.

## Methodology

For each CVE, we provide:

1. **A minimal proof-of-concept** (C program in `tests/cve/`) that demonstrates the exploitation technique
2. **Side-by-side output** showing behavior under glibc vs. compatmalloc
3. **Analysis** of which hardening features provide protection and their limitations

## Honest assessment

compatmalloc is an open-source project aiming to improve. Where our hardening has limitations, we document them. Our canary checks detect overflows on `free()`, not at the moment of overflow. Our quarantine detects write-after-free on eviction, not at the moment of write. These are inherent trade-offs of a userspace allocator without hardware memory tagging.

## Case studies

| CVE | CVSS | Technique | compatmalloc detection |
|-----|------|-----------|----------------------|
| [CVE-2024-2961](./cve-2024-2961.md) | 8.8 | Buffer overflow / tcache poisoning | Canary check + out-of-band metadata |
| [CVE-2023-6246](./cve-2023-6246.md) | 7.8 | Heap buffer overflow / metadata corruption | Canary check + guard pages |
| [Double-free](./double-free.md) | 4.2 | Double-free / tcache dup | Metadata FLAG_FREED check |

## Running the demos

```bash
# Build compatmalloc
cargo build --release

# Run all CVE demos
./tests/cve/run_demos.sh

# Run a specific demo
gcc -o /tmp/demo tests/cve/double_free.c
# With glibc:
/tmp/demo
# With compatmalloc:
LD_PRELOAD=./target/release/libcompatmalloc.so /tmp/demo
```
